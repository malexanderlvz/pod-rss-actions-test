# Practical GitHub Actions
Welcome to my GitHub Actions learning journey!

My follow along for the [related LinkedIn Learning course][lil-course-url]; it's [related repo][lil-course-repo-url].

After working on [my github pages portfolio][portfolio-gh-page], [related repo][malexanderlvz-gh-pages-repo-url], I delved into the world of GitHub Actions.

My repository to explore and master GitHub Actions, with the ultimate goal of earning the coveted LinkedIn certification! üòè
